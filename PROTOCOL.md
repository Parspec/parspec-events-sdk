## How PM events work

**1. Subscribe** once per event type, with your PM API key in `x-api-key`:

```
PUT {base}/integrations/events/subscribe
{ "event_type": "tandemOrder.publishToErp", "event_version": 1, "webhook_url": "https://your-host/webhook" }
```

- Subscribing doesn't update an existing subscription, and only one version per event can be active. Unsubscribe both versions first (`DELETE {base}/integrations/events/unsubscribe` with `event_type` and `event_version`). The SDK does this for you.
- An org can hold more than one subscription for the same event. The subscribe then fails with "an active subscription already exists". The SDK clears the version the error names and retries.
- Every subscribe returns a new `publicKey`. Store it; deliveries are signed with it from then on. If you cache keys, reload them after a resubscribe, or verification for that event will fail.

**2. Receive.** PM POSTs to your `webhook_url`:

```json
{ "eventTransactionID": "uuid", "callback_url": "integrations/events/callback", "data": { ... } }
```

Headers: `X-Signature` (base64 RSA-SHA256 over the raw body) and, when present, `Idempotency-Key`.

**3. Verify** the signature against the raw request bytes before doing anything else. Re-serialized JSON will not verify. Reject anything that fails.

**4. Acknowledge** with a 200 right away, then do the work.

**5. Deduplicate** on `eventTransactionID`. The same event can arrive more than once. Anything you send back, such as an order number, must stay the same across repeat deliveries: PM rejects duplicate orders.

**6. Call back** once per event:

```
POST {base}/{callback_url}
{ "EventTransactionID": "...", "EventStatus": "success", "orderId": "SO-123" }
```

On failure, send `"EventStatus": "error"` with an `errorMessage`. PM shows that message to the user (a failed credit check, for example).

`callback_url` is a path relative to the base URL; every delivery PM has sent uses `integrations/events/callback`. The API key goes with every callback, so the SDKs send it only to the configured PM host: an absolute `callback_url` on any other host is refused, and nothing is sent.

**Errors, the same in every SDK:**

- `verify` returns true or false and never throws, even for a missing, malformed or non-RSA key.
- `parseEvent` raises the signature error when the signature doesn't verify, and the event error when a signed body isn't a PM event (not JSON, not an object, no `eventTransactionID`).
- Every failed API call raises the SDK's API error, carrying the HTTP status. The status is `0` when there was no response (network failure, timeout) or the request was refused before sending.
